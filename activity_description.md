# Control the Blob!

We're running a small demonstration of video game code in Python that's lifted from 
the "examples" folder of the `ppb` video game library: 
https://github.com/ppb/pursuedpybear/tree/master/examples/animated_sprites 

In the original code, the blob simply crawls to the mouse pointer, wherever it is.

But why settle for that?  How would you like to make your own changes in what the 
blob does?  Try one of these ideas, or one of your own.  Take a guess about how to 
do it, or look at our hint cards, or ask one of our volunteers for help!

(If you give up, but really want to see one of them - or want to compare your solution 
with another one - our volunteers can show you that, too)

# Some ideas 

- Make the blob faster or slower 
- Fearful: Make the blob run away from the mouse
- Immobile blob: Let the blob point toward the mouse pointer, but not actually go there 
- Static: stop the animation (make it stop wiggling as it moves)
- Shortsighted: It can only see the mouse pointer when it's close enough
- Easily bored:: It only goes toward the pointer for 3 seconds after each mouse move
- Skittish: Make the blob run away from the mouse for a second after the mouse moves... *then* move toward it
- Lost: Send it in random directions, not toward the pointer 
- Tipsy: Let the blob seek the pointer... in a wiggly line
